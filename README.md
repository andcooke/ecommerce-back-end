  ## Installation
  
  To use this project a user must have access to a code editor and fork this repository. After that, the user must install all of the packages used in this app. To do this, type "npm i" in the integrated terminal. Once everything is installed you are ready to start using the app. 
  
  ## Usage
  
  To start using the app the user must first initialize the database by logging in to their mysql account by typing "mysql -u root -p" then typing their password. Once logged in the user types, "source db/schema.sql;" to set up their database. Then "quit" to leave mysql. After that, they must seed the database with placeholder information. To do this the user must type, "npm run seed". Once the database has been seeded, the user can then type "npm start" to initialize the router and enable use of the api. Because there is no front end to this app the user must use an API client like Insomnia or Postman. They can test whichever of the endpoints they like from there.
